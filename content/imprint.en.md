## Liability for Content

As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with § 7(1) TMG and general legislation. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that may indicate illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the moment knowledge of a specific legal violation is obtained. Upon becoming aware of such violations, I will remove the content immediately.

## Liability for Links

My offer includes links to external third-party websites, over whose content I have no control. Therefore, I cannot accept any responsibility for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked websites is always responsible for their content. Linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. No illegal content was identifiable at that time.

A permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, I will remove such links immediately.

## Copyright

The content and works created by the site operator on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.

Where content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform me accordingly. Upon notification of violations, I will remove such content immediately.
