Hey, I'm Jani – 26 years old, tech enthusiast, creative mind, and someone who just can't resist getting involved in exciting projects.  
Professionally, I float somewhere between full-stack development, DevOps, and a good dose of "Let's see what awesome thing we can build next."

With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and training as both an IT systems integrator and application developer, I’ve got a solid foundation – and as a trainer, I love passing on what I’ve learned. Technology can be complex, but it should never stay complicated.

Whether it's software development, infrastructure, automation, or the occasional wild side project: I love making systems smarter and bringing ideas to life.  
Beyond tech, values like empathy and ethics are especially important to me. It’s not just about building cool things – it’s also about how we interact with each other and with the world around us. Technology only truly shines when it keeps people in mind.

In my free time, you’ll often find me diving into open-source experiments, reading inspiring books, or exploring my ever-growing game library – which now holds over 1,500 titles. Whether it’s story-driven adventures like *Firewatch* and *Portal*, or relaxing sessions in *Minecraft* – I love immersing myself in new worlds and drawing fresh inspiration from them. And yes, sometimes all it takes is a good game to spark the next great idea.

I truly believe curiosity is one of the best fuels – and that the best ideas often come when you just start doing.

In short: I like tech that makes sense, projects that are fun, and people who are excited to explore new things.

> **Cola, code, and a dash of chaos – the perfect recipe for great ideas.**
